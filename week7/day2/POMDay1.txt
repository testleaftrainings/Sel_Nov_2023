Today's Agenda:
---------------

9.00AM  to 10.00AM  -Hooks Implementation
10.00AM  to 10.25AM -Classroom
10.25AM to 10.50AM -Tags
10.50AM to 11.00AM -Break
11.00AM to 12.10AM -POM with Sequential
12.15AM to 12.40AM -Classroom
12.40AM to 1.00PM - POM with Parallel 


---------------

Hooks Implemetation
----------------

1.Create a java class as HooksImpl  under the step definition package
2.Move the common configuration from stepdef to the Hooks class under the methods pre and post condition 
  annotated the methods with @Before and @After
3.Comment (remove) common configuration(feature file (Background) and stepDef)

Cucumber annotations cannot be inherited
 To resolve this
	 ---------------
	 Create a Baseclass and just declare the driver variable as public static
	 Extend the HooksImpl ,Login and CreateLead classes with BaseClass
	 
	
	 

Tags -->annotate the feature file/scenario based on the requirement


POM ->Page Object Model
-----------------------
  design pattern 
  
  -->uniformity
  -->better Productivity
  -->easily maintainable
  
  Steps to build POM
  ------------------
  Step:1 create 3 packages 
		 base
		 pages
		 testcase
  Step: 2 Create a class called ProjectSpecficMethod
        Create methods as pre and post condition methods 
		and annotate with @BeforeMethod and @AfterMethod respectively
		
  Step:3 Create classes for all pages that we navigate under pages package 
 and included the logic to interact with webElement of the respective page class
 and extends all the classes with ProjectspecificMethod
 add return statement as per the navigation
6pages
LoginPage -->username,password,login button
WelcomePage -->crmsfa , logout
MyhomePage -->Leads
LeadsPage  -->createlead
CreateLeadPage -->cname,fname,lname,create button
ViewLeadPage  -->verification

step:4
 Create a class under testcase to excute the code
  Loginfunctionality -->annotate the method with @Test extend the Projectspecificmethod
	 call the methods by creating object for the login page
